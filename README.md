## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Maxwell-Wire/Maxwell-Wire** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving and deploying deep learning models for image classification and data-driven decision-making.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced deployment techniques (FastAPI, Docker) and model optimization strategies.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source machine learning or AI projects that solve real-world problems.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding remote data-related job opportunities and expanding my portfolio.
- 💬 Ask me about Python, machine learning, deep neural networks, data preprocessing, and model deployment.
- 📫 How to reach me: [maxwellwire@gmail.com](mailto:maxwellwire@gmail.com) 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once trained a model that could predict traffic sign classes with over 95% accuracy—and I did it on a budget laptop!
